The goal is to reach the highest score possible in a level.
Each level consists of a set amount cannons as well as infinitely
spawning enemies which gain speed as the level progresses.

Your aim is to shoot the approaching enemies with a correct cannon
to score points. Each enemy makes a certain sound,
and can only be killed with a cannon that makes the same sound.
If you use a wrong cannon, the enemy gains a temporary speed increase. 
The game ends when an enemy reaches the ground while your score multiplier is at 1.

As you kill more and more enemies in succession without any mistakes,
you eventually gain a score multiplier. This also acts as your lives:
as long as you have a multiplier, you are safe if an enemy reaches
the bottom of the map. However, shooting an enemy with a wrong cannon
resets your current multiplier.

You also have a panic button, which instantly kills every enemy on screen,
but also costs you your current score multiplier.
No points are awarded for enemies killed with the panic button.
The panic button is usable at any point, but only once per level.
